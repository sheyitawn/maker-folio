aaaaaaaand it's broken. After I printed the case, it broke while fitting. I only noticed it was broken after I plugged it in and saw a giant crack through the screen. And no it doesn't still work, I really tried, especially since it was a Â£30 screen ðŸ« 


About the actual version updates
Downgrading back to a TFT screen. I think it will work a lot better with the direction the project is moving. Plus I think it looks better. I have alot more room to play with design-wise and there's also a bunch of ideas I have for it that I think will only work with a non-eink screen.


I redesigned the case to be alot cleaner and to fit the new screen (maybe a bit too much). Screen cracking aside I really like the new design, and even though it's a bit more basic, i think it's a good step in the right direction. And the NFC chip fits nicely as well, and works beautifully and I want to kiss whoever made that chip because it's been disgustingly easy to use and it just works well. Anyways

I found a supplier selling them for cheaper, so I'll be buying those when I get the money.
