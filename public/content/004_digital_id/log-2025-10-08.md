Just did a V2 design of the screen to make all the important stuff bigger and added more meaningful data. thoning of adding a camera so that if im at a convention, i can take photos of people and add them to a digital rolodex. Not sure how ill track their name, unless i ask. will probably need to ask for the picture in the first place...
