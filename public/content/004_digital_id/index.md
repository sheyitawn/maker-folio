description: Not your average ID card...

Not really an ID card but I started calling it that so that's what it is now. It's more of a digital conference badge to take to conferences (wow). It's supposed to be cooler than the average badge because it had animations and it can show different images and saved badges and it's also has rewritable NFC.

I have a lot of cool features I want to keep adding so I'll document them here
