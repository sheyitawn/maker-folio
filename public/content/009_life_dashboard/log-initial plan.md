This was supposed to be an overview of everything. I first had to define what the most important things I wanted to track were, based on my year goals:

- Projects
- Relationships
- Health

Then I came up with a bunch of "widgets" that could track different things. I want to make it an overview that I wouldn't have to interact with, because I planned to run this on a screen in my room on a raspberry pi.

Some of these widgets:
- good morning
- (other widgets)

I designed the initial UI using Figma

(Image of that)

Then I used React to create the site. I planned to run it locally, using a master .JSON as the database.

(Screenie)


This is what that looked like

(Not sure if I even gave an image for this)
