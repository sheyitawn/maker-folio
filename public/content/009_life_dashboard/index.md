description: A dashboard that shows me an overview of my life, and tracks some of it
---
As we grow older, we get more responsibility and have to care for more things. I was having trouble remembering all the projects I was working on and all the deadlines I had to meet and what I should eat and when I should eat and which family to call and when to call and whose birthday is when and I can go on forever.  I initially tried using ready made sysi, but nothing did it the way I wanted and most importantly, I wanted an everything tool, where I could look at it everyday and know what I had to do, and when I felt lost I could look at it and see an overview of where I was, so I could decide the goals I wanted to achieve. 

I've been able to get a great deal of functionality from using Obsidian, which as they say acts as my second brain. And I did try to use a few plugins to try and achieve this system. It worked for a bit but wasn't exactly very visually appealing. Then of course I remembered that I knew how to code and decided to create a life dashboard.
