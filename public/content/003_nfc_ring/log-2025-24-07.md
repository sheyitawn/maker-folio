I went through the whole process of making this and being surprised that it didn't exist already, and then I actually googled it and it turns out there's a tutorial on how to make these... After all my trial and error too. And usually I'm up for that but all the super glue fumes we're getting to me...


Anyways to actually make the rings you need:

**Materials**
- wood veneer
- lots of super glue
- a dremel

**Parts**
