For Halloween, my friends and I decided to go as the adventure time crew. I decided to go as lady rainicorn, not because I particularly liked her character but because she has a voice box that translates her speech. So I decided to make it. I guess this project also started my build something for Halloween tradition (going 1 year strong at the time of writing this)
