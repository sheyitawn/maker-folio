This was supposed to be a really quick project, since I had about a week to get it made in time for Halloween.

In the show, the voice box translates her speech ( I think it's korean) to English (Google doesn't exist in the land of oooh), and the reason it's funny is there isn't a voice to fit her: it's just old man, robot or alien. 

The plan was to use a dial to change between a the different voices and play some funny sound bytes through a speaker (I wasn't planning on actually translating, I had a week max to work on this)

**Parts**
- Potentiometer 
- MCU
- Speaker module(check name)
- SD card

**Materials**
- Clay but a 3d printer is definitely a better idea

I first had to decide how big to make this thing. Small enough to fit on my neck, but big enough to fit all the electronics.

I made the enclosure out of clay (because I had it, don't recommend as it took too long but it was kind of fun) and let it harden in the oven.

Then the electronics. Half of the battle was getting the audio to play, and after some tweaking, it was working pretty smoothly. It was really tricky to get the potentiometer functionality working the way I wanted, and to this day I still don't think it works fully, just because of the way Arduino works and the looping, its a little weird. If you care enough you can modify it to work better.

In the show, she doesn't really say much with each of the voices. I think she says about one sentence each, except the old man, which is what she ends up speaking as. But I wanted to be able to use my own custom voice lines. 

I found a custom text to speech where I could feed it a voice sample and I could make it say whatever I wanted. It ended up being really good, and I run a bunch of custom voice lines through it. This part was the most fun because I could make them say anything and you'd be surprised how funny it is to hear lady rainicorn say some pretty questionable things. I saved all these to the SD card and was able to discern them based on their names in the code.

After some tweaks to the code (does this count as integration hell) It finally was working. Only thing left was power, which I ignored till the last day because "I was going to just plug it into a powerbank".

Little did I know, when dressing up to go out on Halloween night, after putting on the voice box, powering it up and turning it on, all the lights went on, but no sound. Connected it to my computer, sound came back. Back to the power bank, no sound. I had no time to start troubleshooting (even though I did try) 

So It ended up being a useless prop for the night. How disappointing
