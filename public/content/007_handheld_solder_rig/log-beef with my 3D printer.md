Writing this a few days later. Maker-folio went live yesterday. Did some work on the design, then CAD. Made my first working gears. Only issue is they are really tiny - heck - the whole thing is really tiny.  So my printer is having a really hard time. I also think it has to do with the humidity because apparently filament has to be dry? Reminds me of when my dad got a 3D printer way back when they were first released, and the moment it stopped printing, I just couldn't figure it out ,so I never printed again... part 2? Jk
