description: A completely regular game of twister, with a twist...

Twister is boring so I made it more interesting. I made this project years ago in (I kid you not) 2020 and have only just finished it. Not because it was hard to make, in fact it was pretty straightforward - it's just that it's not exactly easy to find people who willing want to be shocked. By me.

It's a game of twister that shocks you whenever you stand in the wrong spot, or get to it too slow or look at it funny (not intended)
