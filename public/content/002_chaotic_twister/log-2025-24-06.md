I made this because I wanted to make a funny video about it, and I did, back in 2020, but noone trusted me to shock them so I never published it. Now I'm surrounded by uni students that could care less about their health and will try anything. So I decided to revive the project and give it a makeover.

The only thing I kept from the original was the mat sensors.

The initial software used python and Arduino so I swapped the python with react so I could get a cleaner interface.
