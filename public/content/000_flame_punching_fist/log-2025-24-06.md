I made a video describing how I made these. 

[[Link to video]]

Didn't really go into the nitty gritty, so all the technical stuff is here.

**Parts**
- Electric sprayer
- Arc lighter
- relays x 2
- MCU
- imu (I used MPU6050)
- limit switch, or any button tbh
- potentiometer 

Materials
- 3D printer
- drill
- glue gun

**Code**
The code for these is really pretty simple. The whole system is split into two: the arc lighter and the electric sprayer. I separated the two to make sure that you have to have the arc lighter manually activated before you can shoot. This was for safety, to prevent accidental lighting in case something went wrong in the code. 

How it works is that the button on the arc lighter is connected to the relay on the Arduino, and it only goes on when a limit switch is pressed. 

Along with that, we are also checking for a change in acceleration with the IMU. If it looks like a punch (discovered through lots of test punching), then it checks that the limit switch is also being pressed. If it is, it activates the electric sprayer (also connected by relay), which contains some kind of flammable liquid.

I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say don't try this at home except you're trained in fire safety (or myself)

Then bada bing bada boom you can now shoot out fire when you punch and hold

I found that for actually burning things, it's pretty tricky to do so with just a punch, you know with specific heat capacity and such (the only thing I remember from IGCSE physics) so I added a potentiometer that acts as a dial. Between some arbitrary ranges, (I recommend marking these) there are two different functions. The first being punch mode, which is just the regular punch and shoot mechanic. The second mode is the stream mode, where you can punch to shoot, and if you hold down the limit switch, it keeps firing the sprayer. The potentiometer again was for safety, and because I wanted to also keep the punch mode because 'that's the whole thing!'
